# Implementing WorkLists and Tries

## Overview
This project focused on implementing WorkLists and Tries in Java. This project allowed me to showcase my Java programming skills and expertise in data structures and algorithms. Here's an overview of my achievements in this project.

## Project Purposes
The main objectives of this project were:

1. **Java Proficiency:** I demonstrated my proficiency in Java programming, ensuring that I am well-prepared for complex software development tasks.

2. **Data Structure Implementation:** I successfully implemented various data structures, including `ListFIFOQueue`, `ArrayStack`, and `CircularArrayFIFOQueue`. These data structures enable efficient data processing in different ways.

3. **Trie Implementation:** I implemented a generic `HashTrieMap` and `HashTrieSet`, showcasing my ability to work with advanced data structures.

4. **Real-World Application:** I applied the data structures learned in this project to compress inputs into a *.zip file, demonstrating my ability to solve practical problems.

## Project Highlights
Here are some key highlights of my achievements in this project:

### WorkList Implementations
I successfully implemented the following WorkList data structures:

- **ListFIFOQueue:** A linked list-based FIFO queue with O(1) time complexity for all operations.

- **ArrayStack:** A stack using an array with dynamic resizing. It maintains an amortized O(1) time complexity for all operations.

- **CircularArrayFIFOQueue:** An array-based FIFO queue with O(1) time complexity for all operations.

### Trie Implementation
I implemented `HashTrieMap` and `HashTrieSet`:

- **HashTrieMap:** This trie implementation uses a HashMap for pointers. It supports Dictionary operations (insert and find), `findPrefix(Key k)` to check if a key is a prefix, and `delete(Key k)` to remove keys efficiently.

- **HashTrieSet:** Implemented as a map from K to Boolean, making it easy to use sets within the TrieMap framework.

### Testing
I wrote comprehensive JUnit 5 tests for all WorkList and Trie implementations. These tests cover various scenarios and edge cases to ensure the correctness of my code.

### Fuzzy Testing
I applied fuzzy testing, utilizing random inputs and Java's standard data structures, to validate the correctness of my implementations. This approach helped identify and address potential issues effectively.

## Conclusion
Completing Project 1 was a valuable learning experience that allowed me to showcase my software development skills. I have demonstrated my ability to implement complex data structures and solve real-world problems using Java.
